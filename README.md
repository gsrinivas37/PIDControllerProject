    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Reflections

* I initially set the tuning parameters to 1, 0.01 and 3 based on the lecture videos and some initial trial and error. It seem to a decent job of keeping vehicle on Track.
* I implemented Twiddle algorithm using PID classs with 1000 iterations and using reset message to reset the simulator. It was not as fast but it was tuning the parameters to minimize the average squared error.
* After tuning the parameters using twiddle, I found that even though the vehicle seems to on track and the error is minmized, the steering angles are too abrupt.
* So finally I adjusted all the parameters by a factor of 10 so as to minimize the abrupt steering angles and it worked great.
* Finally I used those parameters to drive the car around the whole loop and it was driving smoothly without going off the track.
* I used the variable twiddle_mode to run the vehicle in twiddle mode to tune parameters and normal mode.


## Effects of individual parameters P, I and D

* After I got the full solution working, I tried remvoing the I and D parameters to see what is the individual effect of P parameter. I found that the car oscillates too much and soon it leaves the track. The greater the value of P, the wilder are the oscillations. Below is the link I recorded with only P parameter.

* Then I added the D parameter along with P. P and D parameters seems to be sufficient for running the car smoothly on the track for this project. D parameter will avoid the oscillations of the car and make the turnings smoother. I didn't notice significant problems even if I didn't include the integral parameter. I think integral part becomes important if the steering wheel is not aligned properly. Below is the link of PD controller.

* Below is the final PID controller video after including a small value of integral parameter as well.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
